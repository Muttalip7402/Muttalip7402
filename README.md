### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an enthusiastic, passionate programmer. Coding is part of my everyday life. My philosophy is that in order to find a meaningful and respectful purpose in life, we should struggle with such cruel world challenges where is an unknown ocean. Learning new things every day is a great challenge for that purpose.
